Spiking neuron networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired networks, which have received increasing attention due to their efficient computation. During their development, many mathematical models have been proposed to describe neuron behavior. The most widely used neuron model for SNN is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, which uses simple differential equations to describe the membrane potential  behavior of neurons. Its format of explicit iteration is governed by


$ v_{temp}(t+1)=v(t)+Ws(t) $

When the membrane potential exceeds the pre-defined threshold $V_{th}$, it would produce a spike output

$s'(t)=\begin{cases}
\theta & \text{ if } v_{temp}(t+1)\geq V_{th} \\ 
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

$ c = \sqrt{a^{2}+b_{xy}^{2} +e^{x}} $
